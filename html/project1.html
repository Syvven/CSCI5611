                    <h4>Path Planning</h4>
                    <p> 
                        PRM.pde plans paths using a Probabilistic Roadmap. <br>
                        Random nodes are generated on the map, connected, and searched in order to find a path from start to goal. <br>
                        The start and goal nodes can be moved around using right and left click and the path changes when doing so. <br>
                        Each obstacle has a radius that represents the original obstacle's radius plus the agent's hitbox radius. <br>
                        An obstacle on the map can be moved around and the nodes will be connected and unconnected appropriately.  
                    </p>

                    <h4>A* Implementation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our search algorithm of choice was the A* algorithm. <br>
                        A* produces the optimal path at times faster than UCS does by utilizing a heuristic. <br>
                        In this case the heuristic is the absolute distance from the current node to the goal--obviously admissible. <br>
                        A* consistently got us optimal paths in an average of 100-200us with 200 tests. <br>
                        This implementation of A* utilizes Java's built in PriorityQueue class along with a homemade Node class. <br>
                        The priority queues are useful to keep track of the current shortest path and the Node class is useful for keeping 
                            track of the current path cost. <br>
                        Additionally, I (Noah) already knew vaguely how to implement A* so it was a safe bet for algorithm choice. 
                            In the future I might come back and make one with RRT. (if i get the time :p)
                    </p>

                    <h4>Keybinds</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mouse Left Click: Move Goal Position <br>
                        Mouse Right Click: Move Start Position <br>
                        Up,Left,Right,Down: Move Circle Obstacle <br>
                        Shift: Circle Obstacle Moves Faster
                    </p>

                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>
                        A couple challenges were encountered in the process of getting PRM.pde to work: <br>
                        > Getting the weights to transfer through the path was tough until creation of the Node class. <br>
                        > The actual searching isn't as optimal as it could be. There are a decent amount of new calls in it but
                            everytime I tried to have a different idea, it ended up being too much changing to make it worth it. <br>
                        > The biggest challenge was finding a good way to optimally connect the start and goal nodes. <br> 
                        In the end, I just added them as nodes on the graph and connected their neighbors.
