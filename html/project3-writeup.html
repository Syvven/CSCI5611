                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p> 
                        This project implements an inverse kinematics system utilizing the CCD method. <br> 
                        The scene consists of an agent out of which multiple arms can go forth. <br>
                        More detail on invdividual aspects can be found in the following sections. <br>
                        The project was written in THREE.js and has a 3d scene, but most of the logic is done in 2d. <br>
                        Features included in the project are:<br>
                        - Multi-arm IK <br>
                        - Joint Limits <br>
                        - Obstacles <br>
                        - User Interaction <br>
                        - Moving IK <br>
                        - Technically IK + Character Animation <br>
                        For the single arm IK, the arm has 10 segments, each of length 10. <br>
                        For the multi-arm IK, the main arm has 5 segments, and each sub arm have 5 segments as well. <br>

                    <br>

                    <h4>CCD</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cyclic Coordinate Descent was the method I used to implement Inverse Kinematics in this project. <br>
                        The process of Cyclic Coordinate Descent is thus: <br><br>
                        - Iterate from the end of the arm to the root <br>
                        - At each joint calculate the vector to the goal and to the end effector <br>
                        - Find the angle between those two vectors, and add it to the angle of the joint <br>
                        - Update the position of every joint after this angle has been calculated <br>
                        <br>
                        The nice part about Cyclic Coordinate Descent is that it is pretty easy to implement <br>
                            both angle restrictions and rotational limits. <br>
                        In my implementation, both the angle and turn speed are limited. <br>
                        The first segment in the arm is limited to a single angle relative to the kiwi agent. <br>
                        This angle limitation makes it look like the arm is coming straight out of the kiwi, which I think looks pretty good :) <br>
                        The rest of the angles are limited to +-30 degrees so that they have some movement, but not too much. <br>
                        Additionally, the change in angle is limited by an acceleration variable set to 0.5. <br>
                        Overall, I think these limitation make the lazer arm look pretty natural for what it is. <br>
                        It's not necessarily human, but it works well for being a lazer that picks things up! <br>

                    <h4>Interaction</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most of the scene is interaction--the above video shows off all these features. <br>
                        The kiwi agent can be moved around using the following keys: <br><br>
                        - w/a/s/d or up/down/left/right move the kiwi in the 4 directions <br>
                        - the kiwi will follow the mouse <br>
                        - holding left mouse button makes the IK arm / lazer go out from the kiwi and search for the nearest box(es). <br>
                        - right mouse button can move around boxes when hovering over them. <br>
                        - the GUI on the top right can toggle between single IK arm and split IK arm (two arms) <br>
                        - the GUI can also unlock the camera, allowing the user to move around the scene <br><br>

                        Once the lazer reaches a box that it is traveling towards, it picks up the box and will carry the box <br>
                            until the user lets go of the left mouse button, at which point the IK arm will retract and the box will <br>
                            be put down. <br><br>

                        There is collision in the scene as well. The kiwi, boxes, and lazer will not go outside the walls. <br>
                        Additionally, the lazer goes around the boxes. <br>
                        All collisions use circular hitboxes for reasons that I will explain in the challenges section :) <br><br>

                        The kiwi also has a walking cycle of his own, controlled by the animation mixer in THREE. <br>

                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>
                        Woo boy. I am not at all happy with this. <br>
                        There are so many aspects of this project that just did not go how I wanted them to. <br>
                        The main thing that went wrong is I just did not have time, so many assignments in so many classes all at once...<br>
                        But beyond that, I was just unsure how to go about much of this, or maybe wanted to do more than I could. <br>
                        At first, I wanted to have full rigid body interaction along with 3d IK in the scene, however, this just proved to be infeasible. <br>
                        Collision is kind of weird as well. <br>
                        At first I was going to try to figure out how to make the boxes collided, but after realising I just did <br>
                            not have the time to do that, I changed all the hitboxes to circles. <br>
                        Even while doing this, the arm gets a bit wonky when around the boxes because I wasn't sure how to handle them having different angles. <br>
                        Overall, I just really had to reign my sights in a bit if I wanted to get anything good out. <br>
                        In the end I think it turned out okay but I idk its just not up to my standards. <br><br>

                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    <p> 
                        For part 2, I implemented CCD and FABRIK. <br>
                        As CCD was described above, I will only describe FABRIK in depth. <br>
                        FABRIK, unlike CCD, doesn't use the angles of each limb to determine where to go, <br>
                        in fact, FABRIK doesn't use the angles pretty much at all. <br>
                        FABRIK consists of a backward pass and a forward pass. <br>
                        In the backward pass, FABRIK sets the end effector position to be at the goal, <br>
                        and updates all the other positions based on the end effectors position. <br>
                        This leads to the root node no longer being at the origin, thus, FABRIK resets the start node <br>
                        to the origin and makes the forward pass, updating all the nodes to now be in line. <br>
                        It turns out this is a very efficient way of updating. <br>
                        <br>
                        There are some very noticeable differences between the two, even just in 2d. <br>
                        The first is that CCD looks, well, more natural. <br>
                        Even without any acceleration limitation or angle limits on either, CCD still has a bit <br>
                        of a floatiness to it that you might find in an actual arm. <br>
                        Because of the efficiency of FABRIK, it is very stiff and really reaches out towards the goal. <br>
                        This might be of use in situations where speed to the goal matters, however, it does look slightly more unnatural. <br>
                        <br>
                        I didn't implement angle limits on the FABRIK implementation fully, however, I did try a little bit. <br>
                        I can fully say that it is much harder to do angle limitations with FABRIK than it is with CCD. <br>
                        With CCD, it is as easy as a couple if statements, however, it is much more involved with FABRIK. <br>
                        As for whole complication, in the end, FABRIK was much easier to implement, and, really, much easier to understand. <br>
                        There is not finding angles between two vectors with FABRIK or calling a function that updates everything for every iteration through the loop. <br>
                        All that FABRIK is is reaching out to the goal, maybe a bit too far, then correcting. No angles to worry about. <br>
                        While this makes it efficient and easy, as I mentioned before, it does look slightly more unnatural, at least with no constraints. <br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, although I did not implement this aspect either (see the reasons above), it is clear to see that FABRIK would be much <br>
                        easier to implement in 3d. There would be no need to worry about angles or quaternions, unless of course you were implementing constraints. <br>
                        <br>
