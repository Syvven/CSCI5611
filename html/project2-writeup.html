                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p> 
                        The goal of part 1 of project 2 was to implement a realistic looking rope or cloth simulation
                            utilizing a mass-spring system. <br>
                        The required feature is multiple ropes in at least 2D that interact with the environment. <br>
                        The features that I implemented include a Cloth simulation in 3D with a camera, lights, and 
                            models that the cloth can interact with. <br>
                        Additionally, I implemented air drag and user interaction into the simulation to make it more 
                            realistic. <br>
                        In depth explanations of each individual feature, as well as control schemes, are in the next 
                            section. <br>
                        Overall, I am very happy with how this turned out. It doesn't have quite as fun of a scene as 
                            previous work but the user controls are much more extensive. <br>
                        If I come back to this in the future, spicing the scene up a bit would definitely be one of my
                            priorities :) <br>
                        Another future addition I might add is tearing the cloth because it seems kind of doable and I
                            have some thoughts on how to implement.

                    <h4>Cloth Simulation (Multiple Ropes)</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Features</b> 
                        <br>
                        The simulation includes a single cloth, initially paused in space. <br>
                        The cloth implements a mass spring system in order to give the, well, cloth look. <br>
                        Although all of the values can be changed for the cloth, the initial values of <br>
                            - Spring Coefficient = 100 <br>
                            - Damping Factor = 50 <br>
                            - Mass = 1 <br>
                            - Rest Length = 2 <br>
                        provide the best looking results in my opinion. <br>
                        It consists of 20 vertical nodes and 12 horizontal nodes and runs at 0-60fps depending on 
                            what modifications were made to the simulation using the controls. <br>
                        Very helpful, I know. <br>
                        Utilizing the code provided in class as a base, the forces are calculated in both
                            vertical and horizontal directions along the nodes. <br>
                        Additionally, gravity and drag forces are factored in. <br>
                        Using typical eulerian integration led to not good results, thus, I replaced that with
                            Heun's integration method, which is second-order accurate, and 200 base timesteps per frame
                            with a base dt of 1/200. <br>
                        This produces good looking results while not being too slow and not doing, frankly, 
                            unnecessary work that another method like RK4 might do. <br>
                        Additionally, there are multiple obstacles that the cloth can interact with. <br>
                        The main obstacle is a kiwi whose hitbox consists of a sphere for the head and a sphere for 
                         the body, both different sizes. <br>
                        Collision is handled by checking if the point is inside the sphere and moving it out 
                            like we have for previous assignments. <br>
                        There is also a bathtub which has a box-like hitbox. <br>
                        Collision handling for the bathtub works by checking if the point is in the bounding box,
                        then determining which edge its closest too, and moving it to that edge. <br>

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Challenges</b>
                        <br>
                        There were numerous challenges with this portion, some overcome and some still unresolved. <br>
                        Starting with the cloth itself, one of the first challenges that I encountered was obviously 
                         the parameter tuning. <br>
                        It was an interesting process to try to figure out which parameters made it look nice. <br> <br>
                        The second, and probably largest challenge I faced with the cloth was one of integration. <br>
                        From the start of making the cloth, I attempted to implement RK4 integration and thought I 
                            had it working. <br>
                        The movement of the cloth looked natural and all seemed well, however, issues started arising 
                            when I attempted to implement collision and movement of the cloth. <br>
                        The cloth seemed to not move in the x-direction and, while being reactive to collision, did 
                            not go back to a resting state after the collision. <br>
                        I racked my brain for a solid day trying to figure out what was going wrong. <br>
                        I tried everything from changing parameters more, to changing the way the forces worked, 
                            to combing through my code to see if I was maniuplating vectors incorrectly. <br>
                        Nothing seemed to work. <br>
                        It was not until I took a much deeper look at the integration that I realized I was doing 
                            it wrong. <br>
                        I took an hour or two to look more into RK4 integration with acceleration, position, and 
                            velocity, and came out with a better understanding of it. <br>
                        I threw away all my RK4 integration code, and implemented Heun's method, and, after some 
                        tinkering, it finally worked as it should. <br><br>

                        The third challenge that I faced, and still am facing, came much later in the process, almost 
                            at the end. <br>
                        After tinkering with some PhysicalMaterial properties and getting the cloth to look like glass
                            with condensation on it, my girlfriend suggested that I put in a little bathtub model and 
                            have the kiwi sit in the bathtub behind the cloth like a curtain. <br>
                        I thought this would be really funny so I decided to put it in. <br>
                        With the bathtub model loaded, I realized I would need to implement collision detection with
                            a Box object. <br>
                        After some thinking, I got it mostly working, however, with corners and edges, the geometry 
                            kind of clips through. <br>
                        It looked bad if I made the points get pushed much further out so I just left it as it wasn't 
                            too awful. <br>
                        This is an issue that remains unsolved though, and applies to the spheres as well. <br>
                        If the vertices stretch far enough apart, the spheres can just go straight through the gaps
                            between the vertices. <br>
                        This problem might be able to be solved by implementing ripping and tearing, however,
                            I do not have the time for that at the moment. <br>

                    <br>

                    <h4>Air Drag</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Features</b>
                        <br>
                        Air drag allows the cloth to look even more realistic by applying a force proportional to the 
                        alignment of the face normal and the wind direction. <br>
                        The simulation represents drag using the equation shown in class where the total 
                            force is equal to <br>
                        <b>0.5 * dragCoefficient * airDensity * |v|^2 * n</b> <br>
                        where |v|^2 * n is equal to <br>
                        <b>nStar * ( v.length() * v.dot( nStar ) ) / ( 2 * nStar.length() )</b> <br>
                        where v is equal to <br>
                        <b>(v1 + v2 + v3 + v4)/4 - windForce</b> <br>
                        and nStar is equal to <br>
                        <b>(p3 - p1) x (p2 - p1)</b> <br>
                        The drag force is then split equally between each of the four vertices.
                        I don't know what else to say about this besides that it makes it look really good!

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Challenges</b>
                        <br>
                        Not many challenges came with air drag.
                        The biggest challenge is that, with drag on and too big of a rest length, if the cloth 
                        is moved too fast, it'll disappear. <br>
                        This is slightly remedied by lowering the Spring Constant. 
                        Another challenge is that, with air drag on, the cloth being on the ground doesn't look 
                            *too* great. <br>
                        It kinda bunches up in one spot rather than spreading out like it does without drag. <br>
                        This isn't awful in the end and could be remedied by handling collision between vertices,
                            however,
                        I didn't implement that. <br>
                        Besides those, implementing drag was relatively hiccup free.

                    <h4>3D Rendering, Camera, Lights, Models</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Features</b>
                        <br>
                        The rendering of the scene really brings it to life. <br>
                        To start, the whole scene is rendered in 3d with models, lights, camera, and controls. <br>
                        The controls will be expanded on in the next section. <br>
                        The camera is a THREE.js perspective camera utilizing orbit controls to look around. <br>
                        Left clicking and dragging will move around in an orbit motion. <br>
                        Right clicking allows the user to move the position the camera is looking at. <br>
                        Scrolling with the mouse allows the user to zoom in and out on the focus point. <br>
                        There is a hemisphere light in the scene as well as a point light near the middle. <br>
                        The kiwi and bathtub are rendered using glb and obj models respectively. <br>
                        The cloth is rendered using a THREE.js PlaneGeometry with a MeshPhysicalMaterial to allow for 
                            a sort of glass look if the user wants. <br>
                        This method of rendering also allows the user to change vertex colors if they wish to make a 
                            gradient. <br>
                        There is also a floor and the axes are labeled (r,g,b to x,y,z).

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Challenges</b>
                        <br>
                        A couple challenges were faced here. <br>
                        Definitely the biggest challenge would have to be the rendering of the cloth itself. <br>
                        When I started, I was new to THREE.js, and am still new to 3d rendering in general, so 
                            I decided to use THREE's BufferGeometry in order to define the vertices myself. <br>
                        This did end up working, however, I was doing much more work than I had to, and led to 
                            some issues down the line. <br>
                        When I attempted to add smooth shading to the cloth, nothing I did worked, so I looked a bit
                            and found out it was because I was using plain BufferGeometry rather than something like 
                            PlaneGeometry. <br>
                        Once I switched over, not only was it smooth shaded, but the vertices were much easier to change 
                            as well. <br>
                        Outside of that, not too many major issues were encountered with this portion.

                    <h4>User Interaction</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Features</b>
                        <br>
                        The user interaction of the simulation is quite extensive. <br>
                        Almost every aspect of it can be changed with the control panel on the right. <br><br>

                        <b>Cloth Controls</b>
                        <br>
                        Pretty much every parameter can be changed including: <br>
                        - Spring Coefficient <br>
                        - Damping Factor <br>
                        - Vertex Mass <br>
                        - Rest Length <br>
                        Additionally, you can pin and move individual vertices. <br>
                        The pin options include the four corners and the four sides. <br>
                        When the corners are pinned, a sphere appears around them that you can grab
                            to move the vertex. <br>
                        Possibly the biggest change you can do is changing the number of nodes 
                            both horizontally and vertically. <br>
                        Using this setting automatically resets the simulation to apply the node changes 
                            as it has to completely remake the PlaneGeometry. <br>
                        If I come back to it in the future, I want to add the ability to pin any vertex. <br>

                        <br> 
                        <b>Cloth Color Controls</b>
                        <br> 
                        All of the aspects of physical material can be changed including: <br>
                        - Attenuation Color <br>
                        - Attenuation Distance <br>
                        - Clear Coat <br>
                        - Clear Coat Roughness <br>
                        - Index of Refraction <br>
                        - Reflectivity <br>
                        - Sheen <br>
                        - Sheen Roughness <br>
                        - Sheen Color <br>
                        - Specular Intensity <br>
                        - Specular Color <br>
                        - Thickness <br>
                        - Transmission <br>
                        - Opacity <br>
                        Additionally, there is a setting that makes each vertex have a color based on 
                            its current position. <br>
                        This setting is marked as "vertexColors" and can be toggled on or off. <br>
                        If the setting is on, and you wish to clear the color, toggle it off
                            then set the transmission setting to 0 and back. <br>
                        If the setting is off, and you wish to enable to colors, toggle it on
                            then set the transmission setting to 0 and back. <br>
                        Additionally, if you want one solid color, turn the setting off, then
                            change the color setting and do the same with transmission again. <br>
                        It is worth it to note that you can't really make it a flat color. <br>
                        When vertexColors are off, you can change some of the coloring but it won't be flat. <br>

                        <br>
                        <b>Force Controls</b>
                        <br>
                        You can control different forces as well, including: <br>
                        - Gravity <br>
                        - Drag Force Constants <br>
                        - Wind X, Y, and Z <br>

                        <br>
                        <b>Sim Controls</b>
                        <br>
                        The sim controls let you change various aspects about the simulation itself. <br>
                        They include: <br>
                        - Resetting <br>
                        - Pausing / Unpausing <br>
                        - Enabling / Disabling Drag <br> 
                        - Increasing / Decreasing # of Timesteps <br> 
                        - Increasing / Decreasing dt of each timestep <br>
                        - Spawning / Despawning the kiwi and bath <br><br>
                        A couple things to note here: <br>
                        - Resetting the simulation will reset the cloth to its original position, use this if it breaks
                            or change the rest length. <br>
                        - Increasing / Decreasing timesteps will require modification to values to keep behavior same. <br>
                        - The same goes for dt
                        - Kiwi and Bath should only be spawned / despawned once they are FULLY loaded or unloaded. <br>
                        
                        <br>
                        <b>Object Control</b>
                        <br>
                        Each object in the scene can be controlled through the mouse. <br>
                        If the user spawns in the kiwi or the bath, they both can be dragged around by clicking on them. <br>
                        The dragging happens on the plane of the camera so it can be a bit hard to position the objects right. <br>
                        Additionally, any of the four corner vertices can be moved around in the same way if they are pinned. <br>

                        <br>
                        <b>General Note</b>
                        <br>
                        Although there are a lot of options for changing aspects, going overboard will break the simulation. <br>
                        In some cases, resetting will fix. In all cases, reloading the page will fix. <br>
                        It is fun to mess around with it, though, and see what makes the cloth break :)

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Challenges</b>
                        <br>
                        I did not run into too many challenges with this portion. <br>
                        There is a slight bug with pinning the top row, where, when doing so,
                            the entire cloth will just break. <br>
                        I couldn't find why it was happening, and didn't think it was happening 
                            earlier on in the process so uh... *shrug* <br>
                        Another fix for the future perchaps... <br>
                        It was interesting to get used to API of THREE, 
                            however, it was fairly easy once I got into it. <br>
                        Dat.gui is also very easy to use. <br>
                        Overall, no complaints here :)

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        SPH fluid simulation simulates fluid using BOID-like particles. <br>
                        Each particle has a radius around it in which it wants to maintain a certain density 
                            and each neighbor particle will be repelled or pulled in depending on that current density. <br>
                        There are a couple values in this simulation that are relevant: <br>
                        - ks: Stiffness - initially 1000 <br>
                        - ksr: Smoothing radius (h) - initially 60 <br>
                        - krd: Rest Density - initially 60 <br>
                        - ksN: Near Stiffness - initially 1000 <br>
                        Akin to the cloth simulation, all of these values can be tuned in simulation. <br>
                        An attempt at a spatial grid to speed up the nearest neighbors search was made,
                            however, it did not work very well :(. <br>
                        The simulation starts with 1125 particles and runs at 15-20fps. <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <p>
                        Like the cloth simulation, mose of the values can be tuned in simulation. <br>
                        This includes ks, ksr, krd, and ksN. <br>
                        Additionally, the simulation can be paused and reset through the drop down menu. <br>
                        The other piece of interaction is the walls that you can drag to move around the water. <br>
                        There are four walls surrounding the water. Clicking on the arrows on each of theses will 
                            allow you to drag them back and forth. <br>
                        They are capped on how far you can drag them both toward the center and away, 
                            effectively creating a sort of see through box for the water. <br>
                        There is also the same camera as the cloth simulation. <br>
                        Left click to orbit, right click to pan, scroll to zoom. <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>
                        So...this one was interesting. <br>
                        I decideded to do SPH because of two reasons: <br>
                        - I think it looks cooler than what SWE can do. <br>
                        - My gf was showing me what blender's water sim looks like and I got inspired to look more into it. 
                            <br> It doesn't use SPH, it uses PIC/FLIP, however, the guy who made the blender water simulation, 
                            Ryan L Guy, had a SPH simulation on his github <br> (and also other cool simulations),
                            and it looked really cool. So, I was like, "yeah, I bet I could do something like that." <br>
                        I implemented something like the code that Prof. Guy posted on canvas, but in 3D and added 
                            the walls and controls and stuff and made the particles look cool. <br>
                        Obviously, it ran too slow to look *really* good. That's just the nature of basic NN search. <br>
                        So, looking at how Ryan Guy had solved that problem, he had implemented a spatial grid. <br>
                        It seemed like a relatively easy concept to implement, so I wrote out the code for the grid,
                            and got it *kind of* working. <br>
                        
                    </p>
